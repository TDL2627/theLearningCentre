    <p class="card-text">"We were introduced to Fazlin (The Learning Centre) towards the end of 2016 by Carol a representative of SNAP (Special Needs Adapted Program) from Durbanville at our home.

Fazlin's tutoring of Timothy greatly impacted our lives as a family and we have never looked back.

Timothy was taught to understand language although he cannot speak. He clearly understands what is said to him most of the time.

Life became a lot easier for us to communicate with Timothy and he uses his hand gestures to communicate with us.

The progress of Timothy can only be attributed to the dedicated staff/team of the Learning Centre!"</p>
